          <p><b>DIGITAL TYPEFACES OF PAST AND FUTURE</b></p>
          <p>Press Start 2P is a bitmap font based on the font design from 1980s Namco arcade games. It works best at sizes of 8px, 16px and other multiples of 8. Although the design of uppercase letters and digits dates back to Atari's "Sprint" (1977), the specific glyph forms in this TrueType conversion are based on those from "Return of Ishtar" (1986), one of the first games to include and regularly use lowercase as well as uppercase letters in its screen font.</p>
          <p>Orbitron is a geometric sans-serif typeface intended for display purposes. It features four weights (light, medium, bold, and black), stylistic alternatives, small caps, and a ton of alternate glyphs. Orbitron was designed so that graphic designers in the future will have some alternative to typefaces like Eurostile or Bank Gothic. If you’ve ever seen a futuristic sci-fi movie, you may have noticed that all other fonts have been lost or destroyed in the apocalypse that led humans to flee earth. Only those very few geometric typefaces have survived to be used on spaceship exteriors, spacestation signage, monopolistic corporate branding, uniforms featuring aerodynamic shoulder pads, etc. Of course Orbitron could also be used on the posters for the movies portraying this inevitable future. It was initially published on the League of Movable Type.</p>

          <p><b>SERIF TYPEFACES THAT EMBODY NOSTALGIA</b></p>
          <p>Cardo is a large Unicode font specifically designed for the needs of classicists, Biblical scholars, medievalists, and linguists. It also works well for general typesetting in situations where a high-quality Old Style font is appropriate. Its large character set supports many modern languages as well as those needed by scholars. Cardo also contains features that are required for high-quality typography such as ligatures, text figures (also known as old style numerals), true small capitals and a variety of punctuation and space characters.</p>
          <p>Old Standard reproduces a specific type of Modern (classicist) style of serif typefaces, very commonly used in various editions of the late 19th and early 20th century, but almost completely abandoned later. However, this lettertype still has at least two advantages:</p>
 <ul style=" font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;">
  <li>it can be considered a good choice for typesetting scientific papers, especially on social and humanitarian sciences, as its specific features are closely associated in people's eyes with old books they learned on;</li>
  <li>the most beautiful examples of Greek and Cyrillic lettertypes were all based on the classicist style, so for those scripts, "Modern" fonts are much more appropriate than any contemporary (e. g. Times-based)

          <p><b>CONDENSED TYPEFACES THAT "FIT" ANY DESIGN</b></p>
          <p>Barlow is a slightly rounded, low-contrast, grotesk type family. Drawing from the visual style of the California public, Barlow shares qualities with the state's car plates, highway signs, busses, and trains.

This is the Condensed family, which is part of the superfamily along with Normal and Semi Condensed, each with 9 weights in Roman and Italic.

The Barlow project is led by Jeremy Tribby, a designer based in San Francisco, USA.</p>
          <p>PT Sans was developed for the project "Public Types of Russian Federation." The second family of the project, PT Serif, is also available.

The fonts are released with a libre license and can be freely redistributed: The main aim of the project is to give possibility to the people of Russia to read and write in their native languages.

The project is dedicated to the 300 year anniversary of the civil type invented by Peter the Great in 1708–1710.
